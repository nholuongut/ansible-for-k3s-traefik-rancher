Based on <https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible>

Kube-vip Control Plane is described -> <https://kube-vip.io/control-plane/>

More docs here <https://docs.technotim.live/posts/k3s-etcd-ansible/>

## K3s Ansible Playbook

Build a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible with k3s. The goal is easily install a highly available Kubernetes cluster with Traefik and Rancher on machines running:

- [X] Debian
- [X] Ubuntu
- [X] CentOS

on processor architecture:

- [X] x64
- [X] arm64
- [X] armhf

## System requirements

Deployment environment must have Ansible 2.4.0+
Master and nodes must have passwordless SSH access

## Usage

First create a new directory based on the `sample` directory within the `inventory` directory:

```bash
cp -R inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster
```

Second, edit inventory/my_cluster/hosts.ini to match the system information gathered above. For example:

```bash
[master]
192.16.35.12

[node]
192.16.35.[10:11]

[k3s_cluster:children]
master
node
```

If multiple hosts are in the master group, the playbook will automatically setup k3s in HA mode with etcd.
https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha-embedded/
This requires at least k3s version 1.19.1

Edit inventory/my_cluster/group_vars/all.yml to match your environment.

You can also make any edits needed to the traefik config or chart values ie:(adding resolvers for TLS certs), those files are under `roles/traefik/templates` keep the file names the same though or the playbook will fail

Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
```

After deployment control plane will be accessible via virtual ip-address which is defined in inventory/my_cluster/group_vars/all.yml as apiserver_endpoint

Traefik dashboard will be available on the DNS name you specified in the all.yml variables

Rancher will also be available shortly after the playbook finishes at it's DNS name also specified in the variable file


Remove k3s cluster

```bash
ansible-playbook reset.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
```

## Kubeconfig

To get access to your **Kubernetes** cluster just

```bash
scp debian@master_ip:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
```

## kube-vip

See <https://kube-vip.io/control-plane/>

## MetalLB

see <https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/>
